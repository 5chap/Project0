# Project 0

Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

There are nine pages in my project0 website.
These include:

1. Index page: This is the default home page of the site. It was designed with Flexbox and contains eight images. Each image act as a link to another page, which contains more information about what is displayed on the image link.
Also, the Home page uses responsive css styling which allows the page to display a different heading as you reduce the page width or when viewed from a smaller screen such as mobile phone.

2. Cars page: This contains a table with a list of cars. This page also contain links to every other page in the site.

3. My Houses page: This page highlights in a table  a list of houses. The page is formatted using CSS bootstrap and SCSS from an external page. The page also has links to every other page.

4. Charity page: A page that displays a bulleted list of charity donations. This page too was formatted using bootstrap and SCSS styling.

5. Library page: Anther bulleted list page displaying some of my favourite collections and famous writings. Just like other pages, this page also uses bootstrap styling to enhance the page.
